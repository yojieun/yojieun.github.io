                <h3 id="about-header">Where I started</h3>
                    <p>Ever since I was young, I had a creative bug in me. I found so much joy in handcrafting, and it led me to pursue an art degree. In art school, I was exposed to all types of mediums and ways of creative expression. During the early years, I had the chance to shadow a graphic designer from Herman Miller. I fell in love with the creative expression used to set a tone, clarity and draw in an audience. It opened my eyes to the world of design, and set my future path.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>I worked as a Graphic Designer for 10+ years. The first half of my career was in the education industry, starting my journey as a production artist and then a graphic designer. Then finally closing that chapter as a Design and Marketing Technology Manager. I was in charge of designing landing pages, programming customizable templates, and managing the implementation process of portal sites to ensure a successful launch. I met with stakeholders and created project workflows, set timelines for research, ideation, testing and launch. With each project, I had to be the voice of the users, ensuring that they remain as the center focus, along with efficient design solutions.</p>

                <h3 id="about-header">Career Shift</h3>
                    <p>It was the spring of 2018, and I was in a client meeting going over a landing page design they put together. We were at a disagreement on the design. It was not very user-friendly, and especially not fitting for their users, who were an older demographic. </p>

            <div class="aha">
                <p><strong>This was my aha! moment.</strong> I came to a realization that I was already immersed in user experience, and I wanted to dive in deeper and pursue a career focused more on user-centered design.</p>

            <article class="article-about2">
                <p>A career shift journey began as I realized that I want to be a problem solver that lets the voice and needs of the users be heard. So after many months of wrestling with that thought, I decided to take the giant leap. It was a scary leap that came with a lot of doubts and uncertainty, to make a career shift in my mid-30s. But what gave me strength was the support of my family. I didn’t want to look back at my career and regret not going after my passion. I wanted to be an example to my daughters that you should strive to pursue what you love, and that it’s never too late.</p>
