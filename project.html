            <p>Majority of educators use Google Drive to store and share files with their peers. Though it excels in many aspects, where it falls short for educators were search features, file organization and ability to save and share website links. Alternative methods and/or applications are being used to save and share links.</p>

            <p>Focused on providing an efficient single platform solution, Binder allows educators to share and collaborate on all types of files and resources, including website links that can now be directly loaded. Keywords can be used to tag files, producing more accurate search results.</p>

            <h3 class="p-step-first">User Survey</h3>
            <p>With the user survey, I wanted to get an insight on how people utilize  cloud-base storage services and how it’s meeting their needs. Three main focus were what they use it for, how often they utilize it, and pain points. Since I knew that I wanted to target educators, I created a section within the survey that asked additional questions to those who indicated that profession. Among educators, a common pain point was the lack of ability to load and share web links, like they would share files within folders.</p>

            <h3 class="p-step-first p-step">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>With the knowledge of popular applications and the biggest pain points in mind, I focused my analysis on Google Drive, Pinterest and ShareFile. I wanted to closely look at where each excels and falls short. Through conducting a SWOT analysis and closely examining each service, I was able to uncover where one excels, the others fall short, like saving links and collaboration features. With Google Drive excelling in file storage and sharing for broad range of users, and ShareFile excelling in business solutions, there is a potential for a new competitor that offers the complete collaboration tool that can fit the needs of businesses, but also everyday users.</p>

User flows were used to create a sitemap that shows how these user flows come together, and establish a hierarchy. With the user flows and sitemaps established, mapped out the content strategy for the application.</p>

                <p>With the brand established, I built out the high fidelity prototype, ensuring it stays aligned with the brand. To ensure positive design designs were made, a series of preference tests were conducted on three elements. Adjustments were made to the style guide during this process according to what worked visually and practically during the design process with the preference and usability testing.</p>

            <p>With the UI elements tested and revised, the next step was to conduct user testing and test out those changes. The first round of usability testing consisted of four tasks: </p>
        
            <div>
                <h5>Tasks</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>reset password</li>
                    <li>add a new file</li>
                    <li>navigate to a file, share &amp; delete a file</li>
                    <li>reply to a comment on a document</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The adjustments made after the first lo-fi usability test were a success in the initial round of hi-fi usability testing, and users could clearly distinguish the functionality.</p>

                <p>Users were able to successfully complete all of the tasks except for one, which was adding a direct reply to a comment. The results were surprising and the degree of confusion was unexpected.

            <div>
            <p>Iterations were made based on these results and feedback. Verbal prompt on the button was changed to “post” and a more distinguishable comment box was added to appear directly under the comment.

            <p>In order to figure out the root of the issue and ensure the next round of iterations are successful, I conducted additional navigation and preference tests.</p>

                    <p>Users were shown the refined layouts of the commenting section and instructed to reply to a most recent comment. </p>

                        <li>A follow-up question asked if the alternative design with the word “reply” added makes the task more clear. 70% of the users indicated that it does, and one user did not notice a difference in design.</li>
                        <li>I also conducted a preference test on the comment box, testing icon and text prompt.</li>

                        <li>For the general new comment box, the word “new” was added to the pre-filled text to help communicate that it’s for new comments</li>

        <h3 class="p-step-first">Conclusion + Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Binder was created to set itself apart from the competitors and become a tool specifically for educators that provides easy file management, and also allow them to share web links all within a single application. Through various user testing and feedback, Binder has become a tool that meets the needs of the user. Going into this project, I was worried about trying to enter a market with such strong competitors, and knowing that user preferences can vary drastically. But having a specific target audience helped alleviate the stress and focus on the specifics. The process had many successes and failures, but also surprising results. The file collaboration commenting features turned out to be more complicated than anticipated, and the icons and verbal prompts were not interpreted as expected. This refinement required the most testing and design iterations. I learned that User survey and usability testing questions need to be better worded and very specific. Instead of going straight into a task question, I need to setup the scene first, so that the type of user response is what I intended. I learned that you cannot assume that a user would be familiar with certain features/tasks just because those features exist on other applications users already use. This project taught me the importance of user feedback and how invaluable it is. If I had more time and resources, I would definitely do more user deeper testing for each iteration, testing out more variations. I would take time to think more carefully through each step and design decision. Lastly, I would build out the mobile application and conduct testing, to ensure that Binder truly is a cloud service that meets the demands of the user all-around. </p>
