            <h3 class="p-step-first">Problem</h3>
            <p>Majority of educators use Google Drive to store and share files with their peers. Though it excels in many aspects, where it falls short for educators were search features, file organization and ability to save and share website links. Alternative methods and/or applications are being used to save and share links.</p>

            <p>Focused on providing an efficient single platform solution, Binder allows educators to share and collaborate on all types of files and resources, including website links that can now be directly loaded. Keywords can be used to tag files, producing more accurate search results.</p>

                <h3 class="p-step-first">User Survey</h3>
                <p>With the user survey, I wanted to get an insight on how people utilize  cloud-base storage services and how it’s meeting their needs. Three main focus were what they use it for, how often they utilize it, and pain points. Since I knew that I wanted to target educators, I created a section within the survey that asked additional questions to those who indicated that profession. Among educators, a common pain point was the lack of ability to load and share web links, like they would share files within folders.</p>

                <p>With the knowledge of popular applications and the biggest pain points in mind, I focused my analysis on Google Drive, Pinterest and ShareFile. I wanted to closely look at where each excels and falls short. Through conducting a SWOT analysis and closely examining each service, I was able to uncover where one excels, the others fall short, like saving links and collaboration features. With Google Drive excelling in file storage and sharing for broad range of users, and ShareFile excelling in business solutions, there is a potential for a new competitor that offers the complete collaboration tool that can fit the needs of businesses, but also everyday users.</p>

User flows were used to create a sitemap that shows how these user flows come together, and establish a hierarchy.

                <p>Establishing a name and defining the brand began with looking back at survey results and the target audience. I wanted the brand to convey a message that it’s clean and organized. Through mind mapping, I listed out words related to education and task keywords.

                <p>Binder was created to set itself apart from the competitors and become a tool specifically for educators that provides easy file management, and also allow them to share web links all within a single application. Through various user testing and feedback, Binder has become a tool that meets the needs of the user. Going into this project, I was worried about trying to enter a market with such strong competitors, and knowing that user preferences can vary drastically. But having a specific target audience helped alleviate the stress and focus on the specifics. The process had many successes and failures, but also surprising results. The file collaboration commenting features turned out to be more complicated than anticipated, and the icons and verbal prompts were not interpreted as expected. This refinement required the most testing and design iterations.
                <br><br>
                I learned that User survey and usability testing questions need to be better worded and very specific. Instead of going straight into a task question, I need to setup the scene first, so that the type of user response is what I intended. I learned that you cannot assume that a user would be familiar with certain features/tasks just because those features exist on other applications users already use. This project taught me the importance of user feedback and how invaluable it is. If I had more time and resources, I would definitely do more user deeper testing for each iteration, testing out more variations. I would take time to think more carefully through each step and design decision. Lastly, I would build out the mobile application and conduct testing, to ensure that Binder truly is a cloud service that meets the demands of the user all-around. </p>
